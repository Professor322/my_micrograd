This repository created in education purposes. I want to gradually build my knowledge base in the ML

Initially, I will try to reproduce https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd to better understand derivatives, its chain rules, gradients and, finally, gradient descent

Also, I am not an advance python user, so I might write ugly inefficient code.
